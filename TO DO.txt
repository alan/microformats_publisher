# Create tests to check the structures created reflect what is expected
# Create validations structure
# Create validation parsing
# Generate a structures directory (maybe at application root) during install?
# Add error / parse trapping to the DSL

# maybe should add something to make foreign keys for sub structures;
# def self.foreign_key(from_table, from_column, to_table)
#   constraint_name = "fk_#{from_table}_#{from_column}"
#   execute %{alter table #{from_table}
#   add constraint #{constraint_name}
#   foreign key (#{from_column})
#   references #{to_table}(id)}
# end

##** Totally re-write tests for Structures and re-write the test formats too.
##** Update the structure definitions to include validations
